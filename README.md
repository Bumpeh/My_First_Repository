# My_First_Repository
Uhh... Well... The name says it all!

I'm a current Computer Science student, developing his skills in computer programming and web development.
I hope to be a software engineer some day, or maybe a web developer, who knows!
I'm going to be using this repository to learn about Github, as I hear it's a good thing to know for those
interested in software development.
